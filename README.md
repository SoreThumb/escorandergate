Dragon Inventory/Organization System beta

# How can I organize all these dragons?

If you buy, trade, exchange, or breed these dragons, you've come up on the same problem many have:  How can I catalog all these traits?

Yes, this game is popular because not only does it encourage interaction between owners of these collectables, but supports the artist sculpting and creating them.  How can you know which dragons have had offspring?  How can you know which ones have the genes that will create appealing offspring?  This app solves those problems by not only displaying your dragons, but allowing you to edit them.

Well, if it worked.  This project was last updated in 2013, so it's unlikely you can use this app. But please--you can fork it if you wish!

I may pick it up sometime in the future, but its original purpose of hosting only "your" dragons may better serve me as a web service to host this data.
